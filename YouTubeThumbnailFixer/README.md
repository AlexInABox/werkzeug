# YouTubeThumbnailFixer

Non-standard YouTube thumbnails often contain unexpected borders or edges, even though the goal is to retrieve the original thumbnail. The only way to resolve this issue is by manually cropping the image. This API serves as an intermediary, automatically detecting these non-standard thumbnails and cropping them appropriately. The cropped image will be returned to the user.
